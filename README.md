# Optimal-Portfolio-Allocation
This repository is the documentation of our (Hariharan, Dhruv, Rishik) IE project done over Winter of 2020.
It primarily uses NumPy and Pandas to perform analysis on data retrieved from the web, and uses it
to determine the most optimum portfolio for a given list of stocks.
We conclude by performing a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the performance of the portfolio.
