# Optimal-Portfolio-Allocation
This repository is the documentation of my IE project done over winter of 2020.
It primarily uses NumPy and Pandas to perform analysis data retrieved from the web, and uses it
to determine the most optimum portfolio for a given list of stocks.
We conclude by performing a Monte Carlo simulation to access the performance of the portfolio.
